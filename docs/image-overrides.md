# Image Overrides

The container images used by the managed components deployed by the Quay Operator can be overridden.

**NOTE**: This should only be done for development, testing, and debugging as it not guaranteed that all components will be compatible when overriding the defaults included in the Operator.

### Environment Variables

The following environment variables are used in the Operator to override component images:

| Environment Variable               | Component                       |
| ---------------------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| `RELATED_IMAGE_COMPONENT_QUAY`     | `base`                          |
| `RELATED_IMAGE_COMPONENT_CLAIR`    | `clair`                         |
| `RELATED_IMAGE_COMPONENT_POSTGRES` | `postgres` + `clair` (database) |
| `RELATED_IMAGE_COMPONENT_REDIS`    | `redis`                         |

**NOTE:** Override images **must** be referenced by _manifest_ (`@sha256:`), not by _tag_ (`:latest`).

### Applying Overrides to a Running Operator

When the Quay Operator is installed in a cluster via the [Operator Lifecycle Manager](https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-lifecycle-manager) (OLM), the managed component container images can be easily overridden by modifying the `ClusterServiceVersion` object, which is OLM's representation of a running Operator in the cluster. Find the Quay Operator's `ClusterServiceVersion` either by using a Kubernetes UI or `kubectl`:

```sh
$ kubectl get clusterserviceversions -n <your-namespace>
```

Using the UI, `kubectl edit`, or any other method, modify the Quay `ClusterServiceVersion` to include the environment variables outlined above to point to the override images:

**JSONPath**: `spec.install.spec.deployments[0].spec.template.spec.containers[0].env`
